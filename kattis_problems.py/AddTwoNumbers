Read and solve: Add Two Numbers - https://open.kattis.com/problems/addtwonumbers 
 
Algorithm steps:
  1. Read data as a line
  2. Split the line into two integers
  3. Add them up
  4. print the result

line = input()
a, b = line.split()
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
print(a + b)

ans = (a + b)
print(ans*100)

  # FIXED 2: convert string a into integer
  # FIXED 3: convert string b into integer
  # FIXED 4: add two numbers and store the result into ans variable
  # FIXED 5: print the answer as shown in the sample output

main() # call main function
